			<h2>Wild dune landscape, flowering pastures, wide sandy beach</h2>
			<p><b>Langeoog is located on the German North Sea coast between the islands of Baltrum (in the west) and Spiekeroog (in the east). About 2,000 inhabitants live here on an area of 19.67 square meters. Langeoog is a truly typical East Frisian North Sea island with a 14-kilometer-long white sandy beach, a chain of dunes and grassland behind them. Towards the east, the island becomes narrower and less populated up to the nature reserve at the east end, which is completely left to nature. In spring, the unique natural landscape of the Wadden Sea World Heritage Site awakens. Then the blooming island can be explored by bike or on hikes through dune valleys and on the fine sandy natural beach.</b></p>

			<h2>The Beach as a GYM Center</h2>
			<p><b>Almost all year round, a unique sports and activity program is offered from Sundays to Fridays. As soon as the temperatures rise, there are many options on the sports beach, from the early "Fit in the Day" to "Sandcastle Building," "Beach Soccer" and "Bootcamp" in the afternoon to the evening "Athletic Training" - and there is something for everyone. The qualified sports trainers also need to be in good shape.</b></p>
